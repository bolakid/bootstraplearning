						<p>It’s exactly 10 years since the Ford Territory was released in 2004 as a landmark vehicle for Australia.</p>					
						<p>After decades of locally built small cars and large sedans, the Territory arrived not only as the country’s first homegrown SUV but also one offering rear-wheel drive as well as all-wheel drive.</p>				
						<p>If Ford Australia’s product planners haven’t always got things right, the Territory – championed by the late, great boss Geoff Polites – tapped into a burgeoning demand for high-riding wagons to great success.</p>
						<p>More than 155,000 sales later, the Territory enters its final chapter – with the SZ MkII that will take the SUV through to the end of local production in October 2016.</p>
						<p>Despite the Territory outselling the Falcon by a decent margin since 2012, the big SUV hasn’t been given as much of an update as the last (FG X) Falcon launching at the same time.</p>
						<p>The main design changes for the 2015 Territory include a less cluttered central hexagonal grill that breaks its visual link with the EcoSport baby SUV and links it more closely with the family face applied to most Fords including the new-look Falcon.</p>
						<p>The slimline upper grille also drops from two chrome bars to one and there’s a C-shaped profile to the revised foglights.
